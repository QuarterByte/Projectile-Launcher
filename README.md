The projectile launcher mechanism was made for a Physics project. The launcher itself was fully 3D printed, with all parts made from scratch. The angle of launch is controlled by a stepper motor and an Arduino Uno, controlling the degree with up to half a degree of precision. The launcher landed on a specified target ten times out of ten, earning a perfect grade for accuracy. The code for the stepper motor was made in C++.

The files for the 3D printed launcher parts are included in this repository, all made from scratch. They were printed using a creality 3D Pro 3D printer, although any 3D printer would suffice. Any infill above 20% would work well, 50% is the infill that was used for my project. The three different files seperate the projects into the gears used, the base, and the launcher. 

The gears were scaled down by 10% of their size in the file during slicing, playing around with the size will help adjust the accuracy of the angle. With 10%, the gears were accurate to about half a degree with the stepper motor used.
