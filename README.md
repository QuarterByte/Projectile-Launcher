The projectile launcher mechanism was made for a Physics project. The launcher itself was fully 3D printed, with all parts made from scratch. The angle of launch is controlled by a stepper motor and an Arduino Uno, controlling the degree with up to half a degree of precision. The launcher landed on a specified target ten times out of ten, earning a perfect grade for accuracy. The code for the stepper motor was made in C++.
